# How to use this freeware:   
1. Download the documents 'Diffusion.m' and 'Diffusion.fig'; 
2. Open the 'Difussion.m' with Matlab.              
3. Before running it, please ensure the two documents locate in the same folder.                                               
4. Click 'Run' in Matlab toolstrip under 'EDITOR'. 
5. The GUI (User Interface) shall show up.
6. Specify the values for each user-define parameters;     
7. Click the 'Run' botton in GUI when everything is ready;  
8. The instant result will be plotted in the right panel;   
9. Click the 'Stop' button in GUI to stop the calculation at any time;
10. An animation will be saved in the document-located folder after each time of calculation. Please rename it immediately otherwiseit will be overwritten.
